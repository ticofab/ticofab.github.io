Hi, I'm Fabio - software engineer, conference speaker, and community leader based in Amsterdam. While building my 
own start up, I fell in love with Akka, Scala, and Reactive systems, so much so that I founded the 2000-member strong 
Reactive Amsterdam meetup. 

I specialize in architectures for distributed Reactive systems, bridging application level and cloud orchestrators like Kubernetes.
I love speaking about the importance of integration between application logic and infrastructure, and have done so at many
conferences (like the *O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference* and the *Reactive Summit*). 

Please check a list of [my talks](http://ticofab.io/talks/) andmy full [Resume](http://ticofab.io/assets/cv/fabio_tiriticco_cv_2019.pdf).

If you need help with modernizing your stack or improving its performance, do get in touch! An [email](mailto:fabio@ticofab.io) 
is the easiest way to start a rich conversation.

**Tools of the trade:**

* Scala / Java
* Akka
* Streaming technologies (Ã  la Akka Strems)
* Spark
* Kafka

**Meetup organizer of:**

* <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Reactive-Amsterdam/">Reactive Amsterdam</a>. Anything Reactive.
* <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bicycle-Touring-Amsterdam/">Bicycle Touring Amsterdam</a>.

When not in front of a screen, I enjoy long distance bike rides and fingerpicking his guitar.
