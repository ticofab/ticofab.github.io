<em>Hi all, I wrote this post at the beginning of 2011, when I had just come back from my 6 months travel around the World. Things got in the way and I never published it, but here it is, hope you enjoy it.</em>

Hola amigos, I thought I'd create a post to write a few more remarks about my <a href="http://famsterdamlife.com/category/travels/chile/">experience in Chile</a> that didn't find room in the previous entries.

<ul>
<li>Toilets have low sinks. Actually a lot of furniture is quite low--chairs, tables and kitchens alike.</li>
<li>Most apartments use still a gas bottle for the heater. The way to get a new one is very funny: you order a gas bottle on a shiny modern web-site, and a few hours later it gets delivered like this!</li>
</ul>

<li>Chile is much more similar to Italy than the Netherlands is. Everybody I told this to replied with somethimg like "obvious" or "of course", but I'd never expected it to be so true. My latin roots awakened while there. I was almost afraid I didn't have any, now I know that they were just numbed. In Chile, I found the same southern-European attitude towards sharing and togetherness---the same value given to doing stuff together. It breaks my heart to reckon that in two months of Chile I had more Chilean friends that Dutch friends after 4 years in Amsterdam.</li>
<li>I felt so relexad in Valparaiso, and I think even my immune system performed better. For instance, one night I had an annoying sore throat, with subsequent snotty nose and headache. Normally, that would have been the prelude to a few days of fever, so I was already quite resigned. Instead, the next day I felt a lot better and the third day it was completely gone.</li>
<li>Every Chilean person in the central region, and I mean EVERY ONE, has his story about the earthquake that hit the country in February 2010.
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://famsterdamlife.com/2011/01/los-portenos-de-valparaiso/">Lesly</a> was sleeping at a friend's house. They rushed out in the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.046321,-71.619722&ll=-33.046008,-71.61965&spn=0.002531,0.003087&num=1&t=u&z=19">main square nearby</a> and everybody was crying in terror.</li>
    <li>Daniel was alone at home. His family was in La Ligua, where his father-in-law was protecting the cradle of his baby with his body. He hadn't noticed that the mother had already taken the baby out with her.</li>
    <li>Anita, the youngest of 29 brothers, was holding her daughter in her arms, reassuring her that it would be alright.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>On my last Chilean day I had lunch with Paulina--a different Paulina, not the one I went to the <em><a href="http://famsterdamlife.com/2012/04/cafe-con-piernas/">Caf√© con Piernas</a></em> with. I don't know why, but while savouring my last Churrasco sandwich I realized that my comeback to Europe was approaching. I felt so bad I almost broke into tears. Chile felt like home.</li>
