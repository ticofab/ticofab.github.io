* **[Android GPX Parser](https://github.com/ticofab/android-gpx-parser)**

This library is there to help developers parse GPX files coming out of a GPS recorder.

* **[AWS Request Signer](https://github.com/ticofab/aws-request-signer)**

Requests to AWS need to be signed through a complex, easy-to-get-wrong process. This library takes that pain away.

* **[GestureMatch](https://github.com/ticofab/gesturematch)**
* **[CloudMatch Android SDK](https://github.com/ticofab/cloudmatch_android_sdk)**

[CloudMatch](http://cloudmatch.io) is my own startup, and GestureMatch is the open source engine that powers it. The idea is to enable device-to-device communication using hand gestures like Pinch and Swipe.

* **[The Things Network Android SDK](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/android-sdk)**

The Things Newtork is a crowd-sourced IoT project. We're building a free LoraWan network and I am in charge of the Android SDK to retrieve data about nodes, gateways and packets.
