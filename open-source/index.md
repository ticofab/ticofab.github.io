### Archives

**[AWS Request Signer](https://github.com/ticofab/aws-request-signer) [Scala]**  
Requests to AWS need to be signed through a complex, easy-to-get-wrong process. This library takes that pain away.  
***Deprecation***: Another project took this library over and reworked into a [broader library](https://github.com/aws4s/aws4s)
with more functionalities,   

**[GestureMatch](https://github.com/ticofab/gesturematch) [Scala] & [CloudMatch Android SDK](https://github.com/ticofab/cloudmatch_android_sdk)**  
[CloudMatch](http://cloudmatch.github.com) is my own startup, and [GestureMatch](https://github.com/ticofab/gesturematch) is the
open source engine that powers it. The idea is to enable device-to-device communication using hand gestures like Pinch and Swipe.  
***Deprecation***: The startup is no longer active and this code is old. Interesting to see how much I progressed!

**[The Things Network Android SDK](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/android-sdk)**  
The Things Newtork is a crowd-sourced IoT project. We're building a free LoraWan network and I am in charge of the
[Android SDK](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/android-sdk) to retrieve data about nodes, gateways and packets.  
***Deprecation:*** I am not working with these guys any longer and this SDK refers to obsolete APIs. Check out their latest
amazing work!
