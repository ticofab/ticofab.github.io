        2003 - Litfiba Official Website
      </h3>
      <p class="refresh-summary">The greatest Italian rock band of all times offered me the position of Webmaster for their official website back in 2001. This happened as I had created a fan-page about the band a few years earlier. I enthusiastically took the role and initially maintained their existing website, until the point where a new one was due.
I took care of both design and development; for the latter I chose Macromedia Flash and coded everything in ActionScript 1.0. The result was something that looked incredible, had smooth animations everywhere and loaded very fast.
     In fact the animation were such a core part of it that I decided to record a screencast to show what it looked like. To me, the website looks awesome to these days and fully passed the test of time!
   The website design was heavily inspired by my Telecommunication Engineering studies at the time. Electric symbols or circuitry are a recurring element.
Usability was the main issue. The website didn&amp;rsquo;t look like anything else around at the time and therefore it was difficult to navigate at first look. From a business perspective, it was also quite a niche technology, while most websites were HTML tables with some JS sprinkled on top and powered by PHP backends.
I still have the .swf compiled files, but the source .fla files are no longer supported by Adobe I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to change them again.
I worked there for a total of five years, which mostly overlapped my college studies. During the first year, 2001, I had a contract with EMI Music.

        2007 to 2012 - TomTom
      </h3>
      <p class="refresh-summary">I worked at TomTom between 2007 and 2012.
While doing research on the Internet topology at the University of Amsterdam, I explored opportunities for a PhD and concluded that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I wanted to do. Those few years in the academy felt enough and I was ready to look for something else. After a few job interviews I accepted TomTom&amp;rsquo;s offer. At that time, growth was really fast and TomTom was hiring about 30 people on a monthly basis!
Over the course of 4&#43; years I covered different roles, mostly in embedded development. The pre-2010 devices worked with a home-grown framework written in C&#43;&#43;. In fact, it was the legacy of the very first code written by the TomTom founders back in the 90&amp;rsquo;s.The core functionality was a loop that would give resources to all necessary components in a round-robin fashion. There were about 25 items in this loop - things like the UI thread, the GPS signal, data connectivity via GPRS, map data and so forth.
I personally worked on the user interface, dealing with user clicks, fetching stuff and coloring the screen. A big part of it was collaborating with the UX department, which was sometime joyful and sometimes frustrating 😅 One of my biggest achievements was the modernization of the status bar at the bottom of the navigation screen.
     Around 2009 we started working on a big project: the UI was moved out of the C&#43;&#43; framework, and rendered instead via a web-like combination of HTML / JavaScript / CSS. Because of my experience, I sat in the middle, working on the interface that would connect the two parts. The result was a UI that looked fresh, came with some &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; features (for instance, animations became a lot easier) and was easier to innovate on.
     As it turned out, this implementation was short-lived. After releasing a few devices, some new management decided to switch the entire thing to a custom version of Android. In the meantime, TomTom had secured a few big automotive contracts to build &amp;ldquo;infotainment&amp;rdquo; systems that would come with the car. The last project I worked on was the Bluetooth connectivity to enable hands-free calling, music through the car stereo and things like that. Being one of the first Android iterations, the whole thing was powered by Java - version 6 I believe.
 Tech aspects aside, TomTom is one of my best professional experiences to date. It was that magical phase where youth and novelty made every atom in my body love the company and my colleagues. I have wonderful memories of TomTom. It was my first experience in a young, vibrant company in a new country. Some of my closest friends in Amsterdam come from that period. I even ran the charity Dam Tot Damloop 2008 with the company!
   That particular experience was actually insane. In my young optimism, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t trained for a single minute before the run &amp;ndash; I just showed up.
This is what I wrote to my friends afterwards.
 I could run something more than 10 km, after which I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly walking with a left leg unwilling to cooperate any further. A good thing is I had a running mate: an English guy who also hadn&amp;rsquo;t trained at all. Those are excerpts of our conversations at different stages:
 0 km, countdown to start: &amp;ldquo;good luck!!! how do you say in italian?&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;in bocca al lupo&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;ok, een bowcah aw loopow!&amp;rdquo; 1 km (out of the ij tunnel): &amp;ldquo;we see the light at the end of the tunnel!!!&amp;rdquo; 3 km, total excitement: &amp;ldquo;hey this is going good man, we can make it!&amp;rdquo; 5 km: &amp;ldquo;wow all these people cheering are motivating. maybe we can make it&amp;rdquo; 7 km: &amp;ldquo;how are you man?&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;m in pain. how about you?&amp;rdquo; 8.5 km, pain rises and questions about physical details too: &amp;ldquo;do you feel your stomach contracting?&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;yeah. do you feel your heart bumping in your brain?&amp;rdquo; 9.5 km, desperate comments: &amp;ldquo;it was pretty crazy of us to enroll&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;right &amp;ndash; this is the most stupid thing I&amp;rsquo;ve done this year&amp;rdquo;  I crossed the line walking like a mutilated penguin and went home with my left knee screaming Italian blasphemies. I could barely walk and I only had a frozen Alaskan codfish to help ease the pain. My sister tried to cheer me up repeating that it was for a good cause.
 I feel so lucky to have been part of the TomTom family for those years. Some friends still work there after 12 years and I know exactly why.

        1998 - Litfinternet
      </h3>
      <p class="refresh-summary">My first website ever.
 Source code on GitHub Still alive Website  Back in 1998 I was 16 and the World Wide Web was a new thing. I was also in love with the greatest Italian rock band of all times, named Litfiba. My nickname was Shark.
I decided to create a website about the band. The site would be called &amp;ldquo;Litfinternet&amp;rdquo;, from Litfiba &#43; Internet. I learned HTML from some weekly guides sold with the Italian newspaper &amp;ldquo;La Repubblica&amp;rdquo;. I remember writing it all by hand in Windows 95&amp;rsquo;s Notepad. No CSS, no Javascript, no PHP. Only HTML.
This is what the resulting HTML looked like. No indentation, all caps.
&amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt; &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt;Litfiba&amp;lt;/TITLE&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/HEAD&amp;gt; &amp;lt;BODY bgcolor=#553E37 link=#FF8040 vlink=#FFFF00&amp;gt; &amp;lt;IMG HSPACE=110 HSPACE=30 VSPACE=30 HEIGHT=45% WEIGHT=45% ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=&amp;#34;../foto/Litfiba.jpg&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;H2&amp;gt;Litfiba (1982)&amp;lt;/H2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;UL&amp;gt; &amp;lt;LI&amp;gt;Guerra &amp;lt;LI&amp;gt;Luna &amp;lt;LI&amp;gt;Under the Moon &amp;lt;LI&amp;gt;Man In Suicide &amp;lt;/UL&amp;gt; &amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&amp;lt;STRONG&amp;gt;Mini Recensione:&amp;lt;/STRONG&amp;gt; Bè ragazzi, qui si chiede davvero troppo, anche per un serio appassionato come me, ma che purtroppo non può considerarsi un collezionista vero e proprio. Quest&amp;#39;album è introvabile nei normali ritrovi della musica (ergo negozi di musica), e penso che l&amp;#39;unico posto dove sia reperibile siano i &amp;#34;mercati dei collezionisti&amp;#34;, dove la gente scambia, vende e compra musica &amp;#34;antica&amp;#34; per collezionismo. Da quel che ne so il prezzo è superiore al milione, e credo che in giro ce ne siano pochissime copie, considerando che a quel tempo gli unici fan della band saranno stati (forse) i genitori di Piero e Ghigo. Guerra e Luna sono stati riproposti, rispettivamente in Desaparecido e Litfiba Live, ma non so quanto possano questi essere diversi, non ne ho veramente la più pallida idea. Potrei ipotizzare che, considerando che nei primi anni &amp;#39;80 i rimaneggiamenti live non erano come quelli di adesso, Luna di quest&amp;#39;album non sia tanto diversa da quella in Litfiba Live, se a questa si esclude il parlato con l&amp;#39;eco di Piero (...sarò re e dittatore...vi schiaccerò come delle merde...la massa è una merda etc etc.(che bei tempi!)). Comunque, pregherei i visitatori di questo sito in possesso di tale album di scrivermi un&amp;#39;&amp;lt;A HREF=&amp;#34;mailto:tirix@tin.it&amp;#34;&amp;gt;email cliccando qui&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;, dandomi la risposta ai quesiti lasciati in sospeso in questa mini recensione, e dicendomi anche di che parlano le ultime tre canzoni... VI PREGO!&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt; &amp;lt;CENTER&amp;gt; &amp;lt;CENTER&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A HREF=&amp;#34;album.htm&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Ritorno all&amp;#39;indice&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/CENTER&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/CENTER&amp;gt;  Beside coding, I was also designer and illustrator for this website. Back then it was called &amp;lsquo;WebMaster&amp;rsquo;. The 90&amp;rsquo;s naivety and tackiness are in full swing.
An Italian ISP named Tiscali was my host of choice: to their absolute credit, the website is still up and running and is still fully functional, with the notable exception of a few dynamic services powered by Bravenet, such as a visitor counter and a PHP forum added much later.
The forum became the most important online platform for fans of the band, especially in crucial times when the band split. A lot of work went into moderating the forum, and despite the earlier trolls (unforgettable people such as Asterix, or a certain Robbie that was an absolute toxic presence), good relationships were forged and it was a lot of fun. Here&amp;rsquo;s one final message I posted when I shut it down later down the road.
So many memories.

        2005 to 2007 - Academy Research
      </h3>
      <p class="refresh-summary">My time in college, studying Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Rome &amp;ldquo;Tor Vergata&amp;rdquo;, resulted in some interesting research in the networking field. I was especially interested in topology matters. The actual shape of the Internet - what does it look like? What kind of properties does a network grown without supervision have? What are its pitfalls? Can we do anything to improve it?
This is a list of the scientific publications that I authored.
   Year Publication Journal     2008 Is the topology of the Internet network really fit to its function? Physica A 387 (2008) 1689-1704   2008 Simulation of Data Traffic Dynamics on Large Complex Networks Hpc-Europa Report   2008 Modelling interdependent infrastructures using interacting dynamical models Int. J. Critical Infrastructures   2007 Topological properties of high-voltage electrical transmission networks Electric Power Systems Res., 77 (2007) 99-105   2006 Telecommunication Engineering, Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree Final Dissertation Printed in 3 copies   2004 Growth mechanisms of the AS-level Internet network Europhys. Lett. 66 (2004) 471     The starting point of the research was a body of work that Barabasi, Strogatz en al. had been working on since the late 90s. Their findings showed that organically grown networks display a degree distribution, where the degree k of a node is the amount of connections between that node and other nodes, which follows a decreasing power law: k^-a.
In practice, there will be a few nodes with a very big degree (hubs) and a vast amount of nodes with a very small degree (leaves). Plotted with a logarithmic scale, the distribution looks then approximately linear.
Such networks, defined &amp;ldquo;scale-free&amp;rdquo; are found in different fields &amp;ndash; biology, sociology, tech and much more. For instance,
 The interactions between proteins in a cell metabolism The contagion network of sexual diseases The autonomous system level of internet gateways  When taking into account the flow of information through the network, Scale-Free networks display clear advantages over networks with different distributions. Notably,
 The average distance between any two nodes tends to be shorter as most shortest-paths will travel through the hub nodes. The degradation of the network&amp;rsquo;s performance following the removal of random nodes is greatly increased as most nodes are poorly connected.  At the same time, such networks are very vulnerable to targeted attacks: the removal of a hub is most likely going to bring the entire network down and compromise its functioning - both globally or locally. One such example was clearly observable after the 11th of September 2001 destruction of the Twin Towers in New York: below them, a key node of the optical connection between Europe and the US was destroyed too. As a result, packets crossing the Atlantic Ocean had to find new, longer routes. Which in turn became congested.
 This was the main context of my research. On the technical side, I used C&#43;&#43; to build a simulator that could build a network, let traffic flow through it (with different routing strategies) and analyze the network performance and behaviours.
I just looked at the code for the first time in about 14 years, and it was obviously shocking and embarrassing. Were I to do this research again, oh boy, it would look so different.
