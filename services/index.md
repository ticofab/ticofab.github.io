I help companies design and implement Reactive System. 

Hi, I'm Fabio. I'm a software engineer, conference speaker, and community leader based in Amsterdam. While building my 
own start up, I fell in love with Akka, Scala, and Reactive systems, so much so that I founded the 2000-member strong 
Reactive Amsterdam meetup. 

When not in front of a screen, I enjoy long distance bike rides and fingerpicking his guitar.

**Tech passions:**

* Scala
* Reactive systems design & development
* Android

**Meetup organizer of:**

* <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Reactive-Amsterdam/">Reactive Amsterdam</a>. Anything Reactive.
* <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bicycle-Touring-Amsterdam/">Bicycle Touring Amsterdam</a>. Join us for great rides in the open!

**Get in touch for anything related to:**

* Developer Advocacy
* Android or Scala freelance work
* Reactive talks and presentation
* Bicycle touring
* Videomaking (I'm a big GoPro fan)

An [email](mailto:fabio@ticofab.io) is the easiest way to start a rich conversation.
